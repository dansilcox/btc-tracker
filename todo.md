# Things to do:
* Hook up a periodic check of https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json 
* Create CRUD API for the event triggers (e.g. a record to tell it to watch for when the BTC:USD price is < $8,000, and what event to fire when that happens)
* Create CRUD API for the events themselves (e.g. what happens when an event trigger is hit)
* Create UI for managing this stuff
